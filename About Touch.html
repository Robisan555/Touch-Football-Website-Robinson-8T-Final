      <h2>Rules of Touch</h2>
      <br><br><br>
      <div class="rules col-lg-4 col-md-12">
        <h3>Field of Play</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The field is 70 metres from try-line to try-line and 50 metres from sideline to sideline. </li>
          <li>If you step out of the boundary, there is a changeover.</li>
          <li>A match is 40 minutes long, including two 20 minute halves and a half time break. </li>
          <li>The Interchange Areas are located no closer than one metre from each sideline.</li>
          <li>The standard playing field is made of grass. </li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="rules col-lg-4 col-md-12">
        <h3>Ball Possession</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Each team can have 6 touches before a changeover is applied. When a player gets touched by the defending team, they put the ball on the groud immediately and step over it. Another player, called the dummy half picks it up and play
            continues. The dummy half is not allowed to score a try and if they get tagged, the possesion changes. </li>
          <li>If the ball is dropped, or the ball is passed forwards (towards the opposition try line) the a change of possession occurs. </li>
          <li>After a touch, the defending team has to retreat by 7 metres, or retreat to the try-line. </li>
          <li>A player cannot pass or deliver the ball after they have been touched. </li>
          <li>A tap is made at the beginning of each half. You tap the ball on your foot and you can run. There is no dummy half. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="rules col-lg-4 col-md-12">
